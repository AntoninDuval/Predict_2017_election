# Modeling 2017's french presidential election results using machine learning on INSEE databases

We aim at modelling 2017's french presidential election by using machine learning algorithms on different subsets of the INSEE databases. Our goal is to answer the following questions : how accurately can we predict the election results in a particular town, based on the several  statistics the INSEE have produced once we have trained our model on a subset of french cities ? Which features have the greater impact on the results or on the turnout ? What can we learned  about the candidates just by knowing the specificity and election results on each city ? 
In a more general way, we want to know in what extend the socio-economic factors are by themselves sufficient to predict the result of an election.
